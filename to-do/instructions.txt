We want you to create a To-Do list using React

1. Use state to keep track of different Todo Items
2. Create a button that allows you to add a new item for the Todo
3. When a new Todo is created, display the todo
4. Create a clear button that clears all todo Items

Extra Credit
1a. Create individual delete buttons on each Todo list, 
that allows you to delete just one instead of all of them

1b. OR Create a strikethrough, when the todo item is clicked

2. Make it pretty

Note:
- Feel free to adjust exsisting styling
- Feel free to ignore proptypes right now.
- When everything is installed, to run the app, use "npm run dev" to start localhost
